This mod provides low tech automation tools for common tasks.

_Mod requires Forge to be installed._

The mod has the following blocks and items:

## [Upgrades](Upgrades)
There are 4 tiers of upgrades that will upgrade most of the machine in PA, normally range but they may do something else. Check out the block pages to find out what they do for that block.

## [RFEngine](RFEngine)
You can put this little item into the fuel slot of any PA machine and it will enable the machine to accept and run off RF power instead of solid fuel.

## [The Miner](Miner)
This is a simple mining block that requires fuel and tools to run.
You can read more about how the miner works on the [Miners](Miner) page.

## [The Chopper](Chopper)
A simple machine for creating a tree farm. Requires an axe and fuel to run.
Read more about it on the [Chopper](Chopper) page.

## [The Generator](Generator)
This is a simple Generator that just requires fuel to run. All tiers produce the same amount, the later tiers just produce it faster.
You can read more about how the generator works on the [Generator](Generator) page.
